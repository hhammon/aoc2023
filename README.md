# Advent of Code 2023

I'm doing Advent of Code for my first time in Rust!

My goals are to:

-   Sharpen my Rust skills
-   Improve my ability to write clever algorithms
-   Have fun!

While there's a competitve time element to Advent of Code,
I'm not going to worry too much about that. I'm going to invest
some time in coming up with an elegant solution to each problem.

## Usage

To run the code for a given day, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin {crate name}
```

A README will be provided for each day inside the crate, which will include
the problem description, solution, my thought process, analysis, and any other notes.
